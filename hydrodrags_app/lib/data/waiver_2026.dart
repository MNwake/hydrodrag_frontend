    '10. HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES that there are different qualities to the 2026 Hydrodrag series than may exist in other types of personal watercraft competition. Many promoters have different interpretations and methods as to how to conduct a sanctioned event. Competitors may have very different skills and riding styles from region to region. IHRA does not warrant any participant\'s ability to operate a high speed personal watercraft without error. Hydrodrags are drag races. While there are less participants competing at a time, this does not mean there is less risk to drag races than any other forms of competition. Hydrodrags have watercraft going the fastest speeds of any personal watercraft competition. The speeds are so fast that any malfunction, error, breakage, failure, collision, fall, correction, or other unplanned incident will surely bring severe injury or death due to the high speed factor on any impact. Striking the water, or any object, at high speeds is severely traumatic. The only way to avoid an injury is to not compete. This event is very dangerous.\n\n'
    '11. THE UNDERSIGNED grants irrevocable permission, in perpetuity, to the International Hot Rod Association, Inc., sponsors, event sponsors, event promoters and their assigns, to use, without any compensation, their voice and/or likeness, photographs and photographs of their personal watercraft for any use including radio, television, motion picture film, video tape, newspapers, magazines and all other forms of digital or tangible media for any purposes of trade, and agrees to display sponsor and IHRA emblem on the chest of rider\'s vest or racing uniform, and the sponsor and IHRA decal on both sides of the personal watercraft while competing in any IHRA event. THE UNDERSIGNED IS A MEMBER IN GOOD STANDING OF THE IHRA AND/OR HAS APPLIED FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE IHRA, and agrees to abide by the IHRA rules as set forth in the IHRA Official Competition Rule Book, as these rules may be amended or interpreted from time to time. I HAVE READ THIS RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY, ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT, FULLY UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS, UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS BY SIGNING IT FREELY AND VOLUNTARILY WITHOUT ANY INDUCEMENT, ASSURANCE, OR GUARANTEE BEING MADE TO ME AND INTEND MY SIGNATURE TO BE A COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW. BY SIGNING THIS DOCUMENT I AM ACCEPTING A VERY HIGH RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH AND AM GIVING UP SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RIGHTS IN RESPECT TO DISPUTES I MAY HAVE OR HAVE HAD.\n\n'
